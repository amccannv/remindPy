# remindPy
A simple to use message sender for Python. I originally developed this for myself after waiting for long simulations to finish in the lab so I could get up and do something else. Could also use it as a notifications for reaching checkpoints in your program.

Use your GMail account (or easily edit the code to use another email server) to send an email or text as a reminder or notification that your program has finished running. See example call in SendEmail.py.
